  summary: Upgrade to Bot account
  description: |
    Upgrade a lichess player account into a Bot account. Only Bot accounts can use the Bot API.
    The account **cannot have played any game** before becoming a Bot account. The upgrade is **irreversible**. The account will only be able to play as a Bot.
    To upgrade an account to Bot, use the [official lichess-bot client](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot), or follow these steps:
    - Create an [API access token](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token/create?scopes[]=bot:play) with "Play bot moves" permission.
    - `curl -d '' https://lichess.org/api/bot/account/upgrade -H "Authorization: Bearer <yourTokenHere>"`
    To know if an account has already been upgraded, use the [Get my profile API](#operation/accountMe):
    the `title` field should be set to `BOT`.
