  summary: Stream Board game state
  description: |
    Stream the state of a game being played with the Board API, as [ndjson](#section/Introduction/Streaming-with-ND-JSON).

    Use this endpoint to get updates about the game in real-time, with a single request.

    Each line is a JSON object containing a `type` field. Possible values are:
      - `gameFull` Full game data. All values are immutable, except for the `state` field.
      - `gameState` Current state of the game. Immutable values not included. Sent when a move is played, a draw is offered, or when the game ends.
      - `chatLine` Chat message sent by a user in the `room` "player" or "spectator".
      - `opponentGone` Whether the opponent has left the game, and how long before you can claim a win or draw.

    The first line is always of type `gameFull`.

    The server closes the stream when the game ends, or if the game has already ended.
