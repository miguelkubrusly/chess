  operationId: gamesByIds
  summary: Stream games by IDs
  description: |
    Creates a stream of games from an arbitrary streamId, and a list of game IDs.
    The stream first outputs the games that already exists, then emits an event each time a game is started or finished.
    Games are streamed as [ndjson](#section/Introduction/Streaming-with-ND-JSON).
    Maximum number of games: 500 for anonymous requests, or 1000 for [OAuth2 authenticated](#section/Introduction/Authentication) requests.
    While the stream is open, it is possible to [add new game IDs to watch](#operation/gamesByIdsAdd).
