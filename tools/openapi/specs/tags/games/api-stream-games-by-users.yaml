  summary: Stream games of users
  description: |
    Stream the games played between a list of users, in real time.
    Only games where **both players** are part of the list are included.
    The stream emits an event each time a game is started or finished.
    To also get all current ongoing games at the beginning of the stream, use the `withCurrentGames` flag.
    Games are streamed as [ndjson](#section/Introduction/Streaming-with-ND-JSON).
    Maximum number of users: 300.
    The method is `POST` so a longer list of IDs can be sent in the request body.
  tags:
    - Games
