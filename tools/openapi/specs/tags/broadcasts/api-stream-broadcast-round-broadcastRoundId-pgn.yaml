  summary: Stream an ongoing broadcast round as PGN
  description: |
    This streaming endpoint first sends all games of a broadcast round in PGN format.
    Then, it waits for new moves to be played. As soon as it happens, the entire PGN of the game is sent to the stream.
    The stream will also send PGNs when games are added to the round.
    This is the best way to get updates about an ongoing round. Streaming means no polling,
    and no pollings means no latency, and minimum impact on the server.
