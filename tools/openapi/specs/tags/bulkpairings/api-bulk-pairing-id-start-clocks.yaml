  summary: Manually start clocks
  description: |
    Immediately start all clocks of the games of a bulk pairing.
    This overrides the `startClocksAt` value of an existing bulk pairing.
    If the games have not yet been created (`bulk.pairAt` is in the future), then this does nothing.
    If the clocks have already started (`bulk.startClocksAt` is in the past), then this does nothing.
