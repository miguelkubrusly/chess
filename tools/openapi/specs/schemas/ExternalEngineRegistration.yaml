  providerSecret:
    type: string
    description: |
      A random token that can be used to
      [wait for analysis requests](#tag/External-engine/operation/apiExternalEngineAcquire)
      and provide analysis.

      The engine provider should securely generate a random string.

      The token will not be readable again, even by the user.

      The analysis provider can register multiple engines with the same
      token, even for different users, and wait for analysis requests
      from any of them. In this case, the request must not be made via
      CORS, so that the token is not revealed to any of the users.

      Arbitrary data that the engine provider can use for identification

      Users can read this information, but updating it requires knowing
      or changing the `providerSecret`.
