# Vendored: lichess_org_api_reference_client

This directory contains a generated Python client derived from the official
Lichess OpenAPI specification. It is kept here to make development reproducible
without requiring network access.

- Source spec: see `tools/openapi/specs/`
- Generation config: see `tools/openapi/config/client_config.yaml`
- Upstream package: `lichess-org-api-reference-client`

Notes
- This code is not part of the `lichess_sdk` distribution and should not be
  included in packaging. It is used for typing and local development.
- Prefer installing the upstream package in production environments.
